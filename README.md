# RAG-Investment-Report-Gen


## Key Components \& Architecture

### 1. **Document Processing System** (`DocumentProcessor`)

- Extracts text from PDF and PowerPoint files using `pdfplumber` and `python-pptx`
- Implements intelligent text chunking with overlap for better context preservation
- Cleans and normalizes extracted text for analysis


### 2. **Financial Data Integration** (`FinancialDataFetcher`)

- Uses **Yahoo Finance API** (`yfinance`) to fetch:
    - Company information (sector, industry, market cap)
    - Financial metrics (P/E ratios, profit margins, debt ratios)
    - Stock performance data (returns, volatility, 52-week ranges)


### 3. **News Intelligence** (`NewsDataFetcher`)

- Integrates with **News API** to gather recent company news
- Implements deduplication and relevance filtering
- Formats news data for context in AI analysis


### 4. **RAG System** (`RAGSystem`)

- Uses **Sentence Transformers** for text embedding generation
- Implements **FAISS** vector database for fast similarity search
- Retrieves relevant document chunks based on query similarity
- Includes comprehensive debugging and logging


### 5. **AI Analysis Engine** (`MemoGenerator`)

- Uses **Google's Gemini 2.0 Flash** model for content generation
- Generates four key memo sections:
    - Executive Summary
    - Investment Risks
    - Growth Drivers \& Opportunities
    - Valuation Analysis


### 6. **Multi-Modal Application** (`InvestmentMemoApp`)

- **Three Analysis Modes:**

1. **Listed Companies**: Ticker symbol only
2. **Private Companies**: Document upload only
3. **In-depth Analysis**: Ticker + documents combined


## Technical Architecture Highlights

### **Smart Context Assembly**

- Dynamically queries the RAG system for different memo sections
- Adapts prompts based on available data sources
- Handles missing data gracefully


### **Adaptive Content Generation**

- Different prompt templates for public vs. private companies
- Contextual analysis based on available information
- Professional formatting with proper disclaimers


### **User Interface Design**

- **Jupyter widgets** for interactive file upload
- Clear instructions for different use cases
- Real-time progress feedback and error handling


## Key Strengths

1. **Flexibility**: Handles both public and private company analysis
2. **Data Integration**: Combines financial data, documents, and news
3. **Professional Output**: Generates investment-grade memos
4. **Error Handling**: Robust validation and fallback mechanisms
5. **Scalability**: Modular design allows easy extension

## Dependencies \& APIs

- **Core AI**: Google Gemini, Sentence Transformers, FAISS
- **Financial Data**: Yahoo Finance API
- **News**: News API
- **Document Processing**: pdfplumber, python-pptx
- **Interface**: Jupyter widgets, IPython display


## Use Cases

This tool is particularly valuable for:

- **Investment analysts** conducting due diligence
- **Private equity firms** evaluating portfolio companies
- **Venture capitalists** analyzing startups
- **Corporate development** teams assessing acquisition targets
- **Students and researchers** learning investment analysis

# Comparison of RAG Model-Generated Investment Memos

**Date:** August 26, 2025

This document provides a comparative analysis of two investment memos generated by different ways of using the RAG model. The comparison highlights how the quality and nature of the output are directly influenced by the scope of the data sources provided to each model.

-   **Method 1 (Multi-Source RAG)** was provided with the company's 2024 annual report and given access to external data via News API and Yahoo Finance (yfinance) for stock data.
-   **Method 2 (Single-Source RAG)** was provided *only* with the company's 2024 annual report, with no external access to news, stock data, or even the company's name.

## Report Differentiation Analysis

| Feature | Method 1 (Multi-Source RAG) | Method 2 (Single-Source RAG) |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Input & Context** | Analysed a known public company by augmenting its annual report with real-time news and financial market data. | Analysed a company using *only* the text from its annual report, forcing it to treat the subject as an unknown private entity. |
| **Analytical Approach** | **Multi-Source Data Synthesis.** Integrated and cross-referenced quantitative data from financial markets with qualitative insights from news and the annual report. | **Single-Document Abstraction.** Extracted concepts and built a theoretical analysis framework based solely on the provided document's text. |
| **Valuation Section** | **Applied Valuation.** Performed a data-driven valuation using live market valuation multiples to form a conclusion about the stock's price. | **Methodology Explanation.** Described theoretical valuation methods as it lacked the market data needed for calculations. |
| **Risk Assessment**| **Specific & Contextual.** Identified concrete, data-backed risks such as stock volatility metrics and geopolitical trade regulations. | **General & Inferred.** Inferred generic business risks directly from the report's text, such as debt obligations and potential tax law changes. |
| **Final Conclusion** | **Decisive Investment Thesis.** Generated a specific, actionable thesis about the company being a compelling, premium-priced opportunity. | **Procedural Recommendation.** Concluded with a logical next step based on the data gap: that a thorough due diligence process is necessary. |
| **Demonstrated Capability** | **Multi-Source Synthesis & Analysis.** Showcased the ability to synthesize diverse, multi-modal data into a coherent and actionable financial report. | **In-depth Single-Document Analysis.** Showcased the ability to perform a deep, logical analysis of a single document and generate a structured, cautious framework when data is incomplete. |
